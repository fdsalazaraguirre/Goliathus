# Goliathus
this is a game with phaser.io to test how it works.

The build should work with only npm start since is using webpack but is not refreshing so I need to fix that but for the moment we should build and then start
the url of the game is on an s3 http://pochitogame.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
